Project Proposal: Smart Food Recommendation System for Diabetic Patients using Hybrid Distilled Model Background Managing diabetes critically relies on precise dietary control, yet personalized food recommendation systems often face two major challenges: the complexity of accurately modeling the synergistic effects of various food components (Hybrid Deep Learning models) and the need for low-latency inference on mobile devices (Edge Intelligence). Traditional recommendation systems, based on collaborative filtering or basic machine learning, lack the ability to process complex nutritional data (glycemic index, carbohydrate load, macro-nutrient ratios) in real-time. By leveraging hybrid deep learning techniques (e.g., combining CNNs for image analysis with LSTMs for time-series blood glucose data) and knowledge distillation, we can compress powerful, highly accurate models into lightweight student models suitable for deployment on patient smartphones and wearables. This approach enables instant, personalized, and safe food recommendations at the point of choice, overcoming network latency and ensuring patient data privacy.

Objectives Develop a Hybrid Deep Learning Teacher Model capable of integrating diverse data sources (nutritional facts, user preference history, and real-time blood glucose/activity logs) to predict post-prandial glucose response.

Apply Knowledge Distillation to compress the large teacher model into a lightweight, efficient student model optimized for smartphone deployment.

Enable privacy-preserving local inference to provide instant food recommendations based on the patient's current metabolic state without continuous cloud dependency.

Provide immediate, actionable recommendations that balance patient preferences with strict diabetic nutritional guidelines, generating instant alerts for high-risk meals.

Reduce computational footprint and energy consumption, ensuring the system is practical for daily use on resource-constrained mobile devices.

System Architecture Data Sources:

Structured Data: Comprehensive nutritional databases, personalized patient medical records (HbA1c, insulin sensitivity).

Behavioral Data: User preference history, meal logging data (photos/text), and wearable-derived data (activity, sleep quality).

Hybrid Intelligence Layer:

Teacher Model: A high-capacity network combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for food image recognition/portion estimation with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for modeling the time-series relationship between meals, activity, and subsequent blood glucose levels.

Deep Distilled Student Model: A lightweight version of the Teacher Model deployed directly on the patientâ€™s smartphone.

Smart Recommendation & Feedback System:

Local Inference: The Student Model performs sub-second recommendation scoring on the mobile device.

Hybrid Recommendation: Recommendations are filtered based on a two-step hybrid approach: nutritional constraint satisfaction (rule-based) followed by personalized preference scoring (deep model).

Alerts: Instant feedback and warnings are provided for high-risk foods or portions that exceed safe limits.

Methods Dataset Sources: Public nutritional datasets (e.g., Food-101 for vision), physiological datasets (e.g., T1D Exchange, simulated glucose curves), and activity datasets.

Model Development:

Train the large, high-accuracy Hybrid Deep Learning Teacher Model on a comprehensive, diverse patient cohort dataset.

Apply Knowledge Distillation using techniques like response-based transfer or feature-based transfer to train the lightweight Student Model to mimic the predictions and internal representations of the Teacher Model.

Optimize the Student Model for edge deployment via model quantization and pruning.

Evaluation Metrics:

Efficacy: Precision, Recall, and F1-score for high-risk meal prediction.

Personalization: User satisfaction rate and long-term adherence to glucose targets (measured by simulated HbA1c change).

Performance: Latency (recommendation generation time) and model size (MB).

Expected Results The system is expected to achieve high clinical utility, providing food recommendations with accuracy comparable to the large Teacher Model, while ensuring ultra-low latency (instantaneous recommendations) and minimal resource consumption on consumer devices. This approach will significantly enhance adherence to dietary requirements, offer a privacy-preserving solution by minimizing sensitive data transfer, and provide a highly scalable, real-time dietary management tool for diabetic patients.

Conclusion This project proposes a transformative Smart Food Recommendation System for diabetic patients that integrates complex nutritional modeling via hybrid deep learning with the efficiency of edge intelligence through knowledge distillation. By delivering accurate, personalized, and instant dietary guidance directly on the patient's device, this system aims to remove critical barriers to effective diabetes self-management, significantly improving patient outcomes and overall quality of life.
